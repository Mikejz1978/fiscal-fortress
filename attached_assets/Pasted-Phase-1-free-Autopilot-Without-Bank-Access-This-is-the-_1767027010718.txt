Phase 1 (free): “Autopilot Without Bank Access”

This is the MVP that actually changes your life:

Core system (what your app should enforce)

Accounts (buckets)

Bills Account

Spending Account

Savings Account

Taxes Account (optional but smart for you)

Debt Attack Account (optional)

Paycheck engine

You set payday schedule(s): weekly/biweekly/monthly

Each payday triggers an automatic “funding plan”:

Bills get funded first

minimum debt payments get reserved

savings/taxes get reserved

only then: “Safe to Spend” is released

Safe-to-Spend Lock

App shows a single number: SAFE TO SPEND

If you enter a purchase amount, it answers:

✅ “Yes — still safe”

⚠️ “Yes, but you’ll short X envelope”

❌ “No — this breaks bills/debt funding”

Bills engine
Every bill needs:

amount

due date

“must have by” date (your idea is GREAT)

funding rule:

fund fully on payday

or split across paychecks between now and due date

That’s enough to keep you on top of everything without you doing constant work.

Phase 2 (still cheap): Transaction capture without Plaid

You have options that cost $0–$5/mo:

import bank CSV once a week

forward emailed receipts to a special email (auto parse)

“quick add transaction” in 3 taps

connect only one source first (like one debit account) to reduce friction

Phase 3 (paid): Bank integrations + true autopay assist

When you’re ready, we add:

Plaid for transaction feed (typically monthly costs once you scale)

optional ACH / bill pay (more complicated + compliance-heavy)

or the simpler “semi-autopay” approach:

the app tells you exactly what to pay

you click the biller’s autopay / scheduled payment you already have set up

app confirms it’s funded and tracks it

About “paying loans every two weeks”

You’re right: paying biweekly can reduce interest if the lender applies it immediately.

But here’s the catch:

Many lenders will hold partial payments until they equal a full monthly payment.

If they hold it, you don’t get the interest benefit you’re trying to get.

The “break the system” method that actually works

Instead of sending half-payments to the lender, do this:

App schedules biweekly transfers into a “Loan Holding” bucket/account

On the lender due date, you send one full payment

If you want the true acceleration, you add an extra principal payment monthly (or each paycheck)

This guarantees:

you’re “paying biweekly” from your perspective (money is reserved)

you never miss due dates

you still accelerate payoff intentionally

We can support both modes in the app:

Biweekly reserve + monthly pay (safe, works everywhere)

True biweekly direct-pay (only if that lender applies partials correctly)

Hosting for basically nothing (so Replit can’t block you)

Since you already pushed to GitHub, you can run this cheap:

Cheapest reliable setup:

Frontend + backend together on Render (free/low tier)

DB on Render Postgres free tier or Neon free tier

Cron jobs: Render cron / GitHub Actions / a tiny worker

Email reminders: Resend free tier

Push notifications later (mobile)

If you want, we can deploy Fiscal Fortress the same way you did SillyDog so it’s fully yours and not dependent on Replit limits.

What I want you to do next (no waiting, just steps)
1) Clean the repo (remove that zip)

Run the commands I gave above.

2) Add a “Money Autopilot” configuration screen

In the app, we’ll add:

list of accounts (Bills/Spending/Savings/Taxes/Debt)

payday schedules (you already started this)

“funding rules” per bill

debt strategy (snowball/avalanche — you already have this)

3) Make the app “nag you” like a boss

If you want it to stay on top of you, we add:

red banner: “YOU MUST PAY THIS TODAY”

daily checklist until cleared

notifications (email first; SMS later if you want)

If you tell me your payday frequency (weekly/biweekly and what day) and your top 6 bills/loans (name + monthly amount + due date), I’ll map the exact funding rules you should use so the app can “auto-run” your month with a single Safe-to-Spend number.
